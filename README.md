# PythonPart ExcelReport
The PythonPart enables the export of parameters and quantities directly into an Excel file without the need to predefine a report schema. It can be used for two kinds of reports:
- **parameters/attributes** of selected objects
- **QTO values** of selected objects

## Installation
The PythonPart **ExcelReport** can be installed directly from the Plugin Manager in ALLPLAN. 

Alternatively, the corresponding ***.allep** package can be downloaded from the [release page](https://github.com/AnkeNiedermaier/excel-report-public/releases). ***.allep** files are ALLPLAN internal setups that can be installed via drag and drop into the program window.

At least the version 2026 is needed to install the PythonPart.

## Installed PythonPart Scripts
If the installation was successfull, the PythonPart **ExcelReport.pyp** can be found
in the ALLPLAN Library:
`Office` → `ALLPLAN GmbH` → `ExcelReport`
